We do not access or store any personal financial information from Your QuickBooks account beyond what is essential for the Application's functionality.

1.3. Information Collected Automatically
When You use the Application, we may automatically collect certain information:

Usage Data: Information about how You access and use the Application, such as the features You use, the time and duration of Your activities, and system performance data. This helps us understand how our custom solutions are performing and identify areas for improvement.

3. How We Share Your Information
We do not sell Your information to third parties. We may share information only in the following circumstances:

With Service Providers: We may share information with third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as cloud hosting, data analytics, and customer support. These providers are bound by contractual obligations to keep information confidential and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them.
With Intuit/QuickBooks: As part of the integration, certain data will be exchanged directly between our Application and Your QuickBooks account via Intuit's authorized APIs. This exchange is essential for the functionality of our service.
For Legal Reasons: We may disclose information if required to do so by law, in response to a court order, subpoena, or other legal process, or if we believe it's necessary to protect our rights, property, or safety, or the rights, property, or safety of others.
Business Transfers: In the event of a merger, acquisition, restructuring, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, Your information may be transferred as part of that transaction.
4. Data Security
We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to protect the information we collect and process. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect Your information, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

5. Data Retention
We retain Your information for as long as necessary to provide the services You have requested, to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
